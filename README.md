# Bradley_Stanley-Clamps Projects

In Order of most recent projects first: 

Mars Rover Project: https://github.com/IBricchi/SpaceXpp

    My work for this project covered the server and front-end website and communication between hardware, server and website.
    Coding languages: Golang, JS, HTML, CSS and C++

Poker Game Project: https://github.com/IBricchi/GamblingFPGAs

    For this project I worked on programming the FPGA hardware to allow certain actions to buttons and accelerometers to send signals to the server. I also created programs to run     on the FPGA 
    Coding languages: Verilog, C, C++
    
C90 to MIPS Compiler: (Repository private for university assesment)

    This project was largely programmed in C++. Myself and my teammate worked together to lexer, parse and generate the MIPS code. I concentrated on the syntax tree and code generation.
    Coding languages: C++, Yacc, Shell, Lex, Makefile
    
synthesisable MIPS-compatible CPU: https://github.com/xw2519/ISA-MIPS-coursework

    The overall goal is to develop a working synthesisable MIPS-compatible CPU that will interface with the world using a memory-mapped bus, which gives it access to memory and other peripherals.
     My specific role was the testing to ensure all instructions from the instruction set were included and working correctly. I created a Bash file that ran an extremely large variety of test cases that covered all edge cases. 
    Note: if I was to have more time on this project, I would create a randomised tester as well to remove the human error.
    Coding languages: Shell, C++, Verilog
